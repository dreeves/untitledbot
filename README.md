# untitledbot
Top contenders for the actual name include botler, botley, beelz, shabot, urbot, ...

goal: totally general bot where we separate the business logic from the slack/sms/whatever connectivity, let it also have a web interface so anyone can try it out instantly at a certain URL and it just does all the things...

1. guestbot (but this is more about a web UI proxy to slack)
2. lexibot games of course. (see more ideas at doc.dreev.es/fun)
3. everything the current beeminder slack bot does including auctions and dice rolling and tocks and karma (also: eigenkarma!)
4. the beeminder sms bot
5. taskbot? forsterbot? something like doc.bmndr.co/elo where you tell the bot your to-dos and it feeds them back to you, maybe in pairs asking which you'd prefer to do first.
6. yootl.es/nims?
7. paybot ledger interface
8. lovebot
9. cobot
10. a million command line tools that work beautifully via a bot
11. wits&wagers
12. tracking predictions and bets between people
