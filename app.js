// Weirdness: If a message that matches the regex comes in while this app is
// still starting up then Slack won't get an ack and will resend it and we 
// typically get the word twice or even 3 times. Weirder still, the messages 
// this app replies with often end up out of order. So if we get "foo" twice in
// a row when the app starts, then we'll send the intro response the first time
// and then send the "you already guessed that" response the second time but 
// the user will see those in the wrong order which looks pretty buggy. I don't
// know what the answer is other than to read the history of messages to see if
// a seeming dup is an actual dup. Or maybe introduce a delay after the intro
// message as a workaround? Or we can just call the bug low severity if it only
// ever happens when receiving messages exactly when our app is first starting
// up. PS: Oops, just saw a dup happen without a restart!
